# Transport-Data-Analytics

Our main motive was to create a data analysis of transport system so we picked Uber system and our project is targeted to its sample dataset and use it to find optimal results 
and analysis. We used big data approach in finding the results. In our uber dataset project we take into consideration many complex and huge request by customers and try to find 
best possible time taken to reach to customers.
